## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This To Do App allows a user to enter a todo item and create a list of their tasks. The items can be "crossed off" via a button click when they are completed, 
and deleted from the list entirely if needed. All of the user tasks are stored in a Postico database named "tasklist". 


Installation: 


1. Create a database named weekend-to-do-app
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the app to run correctly. The project is built on PostgreSQL, so you will need to have PostgreSQL installed for the app to work. Use Postico to run those queries, as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice (in this case, VS code) and run 'npm install', then 'npm install express'
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in a second terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you
